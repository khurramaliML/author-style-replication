# Author Style Replication using LLaMA-3

## Overview
This project is designed for a specific client to replicate an author's speaking style by fine-tuning a LLaMA model using question-answer pairs extracted from textual speech data. Given a dataset of text files containing an author's speeches, the system converts them into structured Q&A pairs, enabling the LLaMA model to generate responses in the author's style.

## Features
- **Custom Q&A Extraction:** Converts raw speech text into structured question-answer pairs tailored to the author's style.
- **Client-Specific Fine-Tuning:** The LLaMA model is fine-tuned exclusively for the client’s use.
- **Private Model Delivery:** The final fine-tuned model is provided only to the client for generating responses in the author’s voice.

## Workflow
1. **Dataset Submission:** The client provides textual transcripts of the author's speech.
2. **Text Processing:** The system analyzes the text and generates meaningful Q&A pairs.
3. **Fine-Tuning:** The LLaMA model is fine-tuned using the generated dataset.
4. **Testing & Validation:** The trained model is evaluated for accuracy in style replication.
5. **Model Delivery:** The final fine-tuned model is securely provided to the client.

## Requirements
- Python
- LLaMA-3 model
